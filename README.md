# quiz_application

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a Flutter-based quiz application that integrates quiz data from the provided API endpoint (https://api.jsonserve.com/Uw5CrX) and presents it in an engaging, user-friendly interface. The app will include gamification features to make the quiz experience more interactive and enjoyable. Key features will include a dynamic quiz flow, real-time scoring, a results summary, and a clean, intuitive design.

Core Features:
Start Quiz:

Users can start a new quiz by pressing a "Start Quiz" button.
The quiz will fetch questions from the provided API and display them sequentially.
Each question will be presented with multiple-choice answers.
Include a timer for each question to enhance the gamification aspect.
Display Questions with Multiple-Choice Answers:

For each question, display the question text and multiple-choice options.
Users can select their answer by tapping on one of the choices.
When an answer is selected, immediate feedback (correct or incorrect) will be shown, with an option to move to the next question.
Gamification Features:

Score Tracking: Show live score updates after each answer. Provide a final score at the end.
Summary of Results Upon Quiz Completion:

After completing the quiz, show a results screen that summarizes:
Total points scored.
A short motivational message (e.g., "Great job!" or "Try again!").

Error Handling:
Proper error handling in place in case the API fails, or data is incomplete.
Show a user-friendly error message and retry option if the API data fetch fails.
